      <p>Imagine a place where you have unlimited access to the best and newest technologies that exist today. Some of these technologies haven’t been released yet and others are so new you haven’t even heard of them yet. Imagine that in this same place you have access to the most innovative devices over years past, and that you can touch, explore, and experiment with all of these technologies.</p>
      <p><strong>If this place existed, what could you build? What would you be capable of? How would you be able to change the world?</strong></p>
      <p>This notion of a technology library emerged at Cornell Tech as excited discussions amongst classmates and friends commenced for the campus’s first Startup Studio. Students were eager to get their hands on devices and platforms to aid them in their entrepreneurial exploration. But, like a startup itself, Cornell Tech had limited resources as it worked to build and grow the new programs and campus on Roosevelt Island.</p>
      <p>When Steve Wall and I found out that our peers and teachers had nominated us to receive the Johnson Fried Fellowship, a prestigious annual award granted to seven business students on the basis of academic achievement and demonstrated leadership, we were honored and humbled. We were recognized by the very same individuals we admire and look up to every day. And because of this, we wanted to give back to our Cornell Tech community and demonstrate our appreciation and commitment to the culture of collaboration on campus. After careful thought, we decided that launching a technology library would be a great way to encourage collaboration amongst students but also to further opportunities for business and academia to engage with each other and build better products and ideas. </p>
      <p>Cornell Tech was never intended to be a place for the old and traditional. Rather, Cornell Tech is a place to instill and inspire transformation of academia and industry. We see the future of Cornell Tech’s Device Library as a playground for the latest and most innovative technologies: a place for entrepreneurs, builders, and creators to experiment, test, and explore new concepts and ways of using technology.</p>
      <p>We have made significant headway already. By the end of the 2014-15 academic year, we already had a small library of devices which were in part funded by our donation, but also by donations from our peers, faculty, and manufacturers. We have wearables, robots, drones, design tools, security systems, and smart home and fitness devices among many technologies. And students are already excited about the potential. In a survey sent out to over 80 students in the graduating 2015 class, responses were overwhelmingly positive with feedback like “This would be so sick,” and “Absolutely want this. A must have for CS and MBA's alike!”</p>
      <p>And today we may only have a small library – but tomorrow this will be the place where the most pioneering and state-of-the-art technologies will be showcased. This will be the place where students will go to engage with technology that has never been seen or tested before, and a museum for exploring how devices have evolved and changed year to year. The Cornell Tech Device Library will revolutionize the way we interact with technology and enable Cornell Tech to lead in tech innovation in New York City. As Mayor Bill de Blasio said during Cornell Tech’s groundbreaking event, “because the most interesting things [are] happening here.” </p>
